                  messenger, or even in person.

                  The bond of friendship is one that is often unspoken and
                  unrivaled. It is a relationship that is founded on mutual
                  respect and understanding. Friendship is something that can be
                  found in all walks of life, and is often the foundation of a
                  successful life.{" "}
